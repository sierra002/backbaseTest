## dependencies
node
`node v14.8.0`
npm
`npm 6.14.7`
angular cli
`npm i -g @angular/cli`

run `npm i` before starting

there's a work in progress to deploy the app in this [URL](https://sierra002.github.io/backbaseTest/)

images are not working in the url because in order to have it i would have to
update the build, so it can change the url for resources adding the `/backbase`, by now images can only be seen in localhost

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
